This is the first section of our course. We will cover the basic usage of [GitHub][guthub]'s web interface and some commands for local usage of Git.

<h2>Creating an account</h2>

Given that I had previous experience with [GitHub][github], I already had an account:

But don't worry, the sign-up is really straight forward.

<h2>Creating a new repository in GitHub</h2>

To create a new repository, go to your [GitHub][github] home page (the cat at the top left corner) and click on “New Repository”:

<h2>Creating a local repository in your computer</h2>

To create a local repository, use the following command inside the folder where you want to create the repository:

{% highlight ruby %}
git init
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Cloning a repository from GitHub</h2>

To clone a repository from [GitHub][github] to your computer, go the Repository page and copy the HTTPS link, then enter the following command:

{% highlight ruby %}
git clone <HTTPS link>
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Adding or deleting a file to your local repository</h2>

Now lets add a file to our local repository.

First, use any kind of editor to create a new file (code, plain text or something). I created a file named "plain.txt". To add it to the repository use:

{% highlight ruby %}
git add plain.txt
{% endhighlight %}

To verify that the file was succesfully added, use the following command:

{% highlight ruby %}
git status
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to remove the file use:

{% highlight ruby %}
git rm plain.txt
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use the `git status` command to verify the deletion:

<h2>GitHub's web interface</h2>

Now let's play a little with [GitHub][github]'s web interface.

<h1>Adding a file</h1>

To add a file to the repository from the the web interface, click on the '+' sign next to the name of the repository as shown in the image:

![1.8CreateFileWeb](/assets/noob/1.8CreateFileWeb.png)

Then select a name for the file, put some content in it, and click on the 'Commit' button.

<h1>Editing a file</h1>

You can modify the content of the file by clicking on it, and then click on the pencil icon as shown in the images:

![1.7EditWeb1](/assets/noob/1.7EditWeb2.png)

And:

![1.7EditWeb2](/assets/noob/1.7EditWeb1.png)

<h1>Deleting a file</h1>

To delete a file from the web interface, select it and click on the trash icon:

![1.9DeleteWeb1](/assets/noob/1.9DeleteWeb1.png)

And commit changes:

![1.9DeleteWeb2](/assets/noob/1.9DeleteWeb2.png)

That's it! Our Noob Section from the course has ended. Continue with next post 'Basic Section'.
